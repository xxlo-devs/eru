## What is this project about

Eru is aimed to help our fellow students from XX-LO in Gda≈Ñsk, Poland.
We want to enable school to easily inform all interested students about all teacher substitutions they might want to know about ;)

## Contributions

You want to help? Feel free to!
Simply create an issue for idea for a solution you want to have/ problem you've encountered and either wait for one of our developers to fix it or get aboard and join us! We can't guarantee that code review will be painless though.

## Setup, Config and more

More data about how to setup, configure and use our application is available on our [docs](https://xxlo-devs.github.io/eru/)
